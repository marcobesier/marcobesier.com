## Capture the Ether (RareSkills Repo) - Retirement Fund - Solution

### Contract

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

contract RetirementFund {
    uint256 startBalance;
    address owner = msg.sender;
    address beneficiary;
    uint256 expiration = block.timestamp + 520 weeks;

    constructor(address player) payable {
        require(msg.value == 1 ether);

        beneficiary = player;
        startBalance = msg.value;
    }

    function isComplete() public view returns (bool) {
        return address(this).balance == 0;
    }

    function withdraw() public {
        require(msg.sender == owner);

        if (block.timestamp < expiration) {
            // early withdrawal incurs a 10% penalty
            (bool ok, ) = msg.sender.call{
                value: (address(this).balance * 9) / 10
            }("");
            require(ok, "Transfer to msg.sender failed");
        } else {
            (bool ok, ) = msg.sender.call{value: address(this).balance}("");
            require(ok, "Transfer to msg.sender failed");
        }
    }

    function collectPenalty() public {
        require(msg.sender == beneficiary);
        uint256 withdrawn = 0;
        unchecked {
            withdrawn += startBalance - address(this).balance;

            // an early withdrawal occurred
            require(withdrawn > 0);
        }

        // penalty is what's left
        (bool ok, ) = msg.sender.call{value: address(this).balance}("");
        require(ok, "Transfer to msg.sender failed");
    }
}
```

## Solution

This challenge is conveniently solved via Remix. First, deploy the contract from Remix's default account. Set `player` to the address of that default account so that it becomes the `beneficiary`.

Next, observe that `collectPenalty` contains a vulnerable `unchecked` block. Suppose we can somehow achieve `startBalance < address(this).balance`. In that case, `withdrawn` will underflow, pass `require(withdrawn > 0)`, and, therefore, allow us to transfer the contract's entire balance to our account by calling `collectPenalty`.

Unfortunately, the contract does _not_ implement:

- a `fallback` function
- a `receive` function
- any `payable` functions (except the constructor which is restricted to receiving exactly 1 ether)

Therefore, one could naively assume that it is not possible to send any more ether to the contract to achieve `startBalance < address(this).balance`.

However, we can force-send ether by calling the `selfdestruct` instruction on another contract containing funds, and specifying the `RetirementFund` as the target!

Thus, we can carry out our attack as follows:

1. Deploy a second contract (see below) **with an initial balance of 1 wei**.
2. Call `forceSend`, specifying `RetirementFund`'s address as the target. This will lead to `startBalance < address(this).balance` on the `RetirementFund` contract since the new values will be `startBalance == 1 ether` and `address(this).balance == 1 ether + 1 wei`
3. Call `collectPenalty`. Because `startBalance < address(this).balance`, `withdrawn` will underflow, pass `require > 0`, and result in a transfer of the contract's entire balance to our account.

NOTE: At the time of writing, `selfdestruct` has been deprecated. The underlying opcode will eventually undergo breaking changes. Therefore, this solution might no longer be valid depending on when you're reading this.

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract ForceSend {
    // This constructor is payable, allowing the contract to be deployed with 1 wei.
    constructor() payable {}

    // Function to force-send Ether to a target address.
    function forceSend(address payable target) external {
        // The selfdestruct function sends all remaining Ether and destroys the contract.
        selfdestruct(target);
    }
}
```
