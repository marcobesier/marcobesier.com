# Capture the Ether (RareSkills Repo) - Token Whale - Solution

## Contract

```solidity

pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

contract TokenWhale {
    address player;

    uint256 public totalSupply;
    mapping(address => uint256) public balanceOf;
    mapping(address => mapping(address => uint256)) public allowance;

    string public name = "Simple ERC20 Token";
    string public symbol = "SET";
    uint8 public decimals = 18;

    event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value);

    constructor(address _player) {
        player = _player;
        totalSupply = 1000;
        balanceOf[player] = 1000;
    }

    function isComplete() public view returns (bool) {
        return balanceOf[player] >= 1000000;
    }

    function _transfer(address to, uint256 value) internal {
        unchecked {
            balanceOf[msg.sender] -= value;
            balanceOf[to] += value;
        }

        emit Transfer(msg.sender, to, value);
    }

    function transfer(address to, uint256 value) public {
        require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= value);
        require(balanceOf[to] + value >= balanceOf[to]);

        _transfer(to, value);
    }

    event Approval(
        address indexed owner,
        address indexed spender,

## Solution

This challenge is conveniently solved via Remix. To increase the `player`'s token balance to 1M (or more), we'll use two different accounts and perform the following sequence of function calls:

1. Set `_player` to an EOA you control, e.g., the first of Remix's default accounts. This will give `player` an account balance of 1000.
2. Next, approve a second EOA you control, e.g., the second of Remix's default accounts, with `value = 1`. Ensure to make this function call from `player`'s account.
3. Now, call `transferFrom(player, player, 1)` from the second EOA. At first sight, one would assume that this wouldn't change anything since we're just sending `value = 1` from the `player` to the `player`. However, by taking a closer look at the implementation of `_transfer`, we see that this call will underflow the second EOA's balance (and add 1 to the `player`'s balance). In other words, after this call, `player` has a balance of 1001 while the second EOA has a balance of `2**256 - 1`!
4. Lastly, we can use `transfer` to transfer `value = 998999` (or more) from the second EOA to `player`, leaving `player` with a balance of 1000000 (or more).

Note that the `to` argument in the above call to `transferFrom` can actually be chosen arbitrarily. The important point in the above sequence is not that we increase the `player`'s balance from 1000 to 1001, but that we underflow the balance of our second EOA so that this account has enough tokens to bump up `player`'s balance to 1M or more.
