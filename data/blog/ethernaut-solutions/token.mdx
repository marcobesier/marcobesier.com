# Ethernaut - Token - Solution

## Contract

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.6.0;

contract Token {
    mapping(address => uint256) balances;
    uint256 public totalSupply;

    constructor(uint256 _initialSupply) public {
        balances[msg.sender] = totalSupply = _initialSupply;
    }

    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool) {
        require(balances[msg.sender] - _value >= 0);
        balances[msg.sender] -= _value;
        balances[_to] += _value;
        return true;
    }

    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance) {
        return balances[_owner];
    }
}
```

## Solution

We start out with a token balance of 20. The goal of this level is to increase our balance even further.

Recall that Solidity did not have built-in protection against arithmetic overflows/underflows prior to version 0.8.0.
Therefore, sending 21 tokens to the another account (e.g., the zero address) will underflow our balance by 1 and result in a new balance of `type(uint256).max = 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639935`.
In other words, all we have to do is to enter 

```javascript
contract.transfer("0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000", 21)
```

in the Ethernaut console.
