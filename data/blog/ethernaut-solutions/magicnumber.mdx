## Solution

The goal of this challenge is to create a `solver` contract that returns 42 whenever `whatIsTheMeaningOfLife()` is called. 
The difficulty is that the `solver`'s runtime bytecode must not be greater than 10 opcodes.
To create such a contract, we will need to write raw bytecode directly instead of using a higher-level language compiler.
If you're not familiar with opcodes and the inner workings of the EVM yet, I recommend working through the [Huff docs](https://docs.huff.sh/) first.
In the following, I will assume that you already know those basics.

To start, note that we _don't_ have to code a dedicated `whatIsTheMeaningOfLife()` function for our contract. 
Instead, we can simply have our contract return 42 regardless of the function selector in the calldata.
To do that, we use the following sequence:

- `60 2a`: `PUSH1 0x2a` - Push the value 42 onto the stack.
- `60 00`: `PUSH1 0x00` - Push the memory position 0x00 onto the stack.
- `52`: `MSTORE` - Store the value 42 at memory position 0x00.
- `60 20`: `PUSH1 0x20` - Push the size 32 bytes onto the stack.
- `60 00`: `PUSH1 0x00` - Push the memory position 0x00 onto the stack.
- `f3`: `RETURN` - Return 32 bytes from memory position 0x00.

Note that the `RETURN` opcode requires the return value to be stored in memory instead of just popping it from the stack as other languages do.
Our final runtime bytecode is, therefore, given by `602a60005260206000f3`.

However, to deploy this bytecode to the blockchain, we need to construct initialization code, too!
The purpose of the initialization code is to store the runtime bytecode into the contract's code storage.
Here is a step-by-step breakdown of what the initialization code needs to do:

- `60 0a`: `PUSH1 0x0a` - Push the length of the runtime bytecode onto the stack. The lenth of `602a60005260206000f3` is 10 bytes.
- `60 0c`: `PUSH1 0x0c` - Push the offset where the runtime bytecode is located in the full bytecode. We will see that our final initialization code has a length of 12 bytes, which is why we push 12.
- `60 00`: `PUSH1 0x00` - Push the offset in memory where we want to copy the runtime code.
- `39`: `CODECOPY` - Copy the runtime code to memory.
- `60 0a`: `PUSH1 0x0a` - Push the length of the runtime bytecode onto the stack.
- `60 00`: `PUSH1 0x00` - Push the offset in memory to start copying from.
- `f3`: `RETURN` - Return the runtime code as the contract's code.

Note that this initialization code is indeed 12 bytes long, which is why we used `PUSH1 0x0c` in the second step.

Lastly, we can combine the initialization and runtime bytecodes to get:

```
600a600c600039600a6000f3602a60005260206000f3
```

To deploy the contract via Cast, we can use:

```bash
export PRIVATE_KEY=<your private key>
export RPC_URL=<your rpc url>
export BYTECODE=600a600c600039600a6000f3602a60005260206000f3

cast send --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --rpc-url $RPC_URL --create $BYTECODE
```

Looking at the transaction receipt, you will see the deployed contract's address, which you can use to call `setSolver()` and complete the level.
