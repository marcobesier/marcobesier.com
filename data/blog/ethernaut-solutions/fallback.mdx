# Ethernaut - Fallback - Solution

## Contract

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Fallback {
    mapping(address => uint256) public contributions;
    address public owner;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
        contributions[msg.sender] = 1000 * (1 ether);
    }

    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "caller is not the owner");
        _;
    }

    function contribute() public payable {
        require(msg.value < 0.001 ether);
        contributions[msg.sender] += msg.value;
        if (contributions[msg.sender] > contributions[owner]) {
            owner = msg.sender;
        }
    }

    function getContribution() public view returns (uint256) {
        return contributions[msg.sender];
    }

    function withdraw() public onlyOwner {
        payable(owner).transfer(address(this).balance);
    }

    receive() external payable {
        require(msg.value > 0 && contributions[msg.sender] > 0);
        owner = msg.sender;
    }
}
```

## Exploit

The goal of this challenge is to:

1. Become the contract's owner.
2. Reduce the contract's balance to 0.

Looking at the contract, we can see that `receive()` function allows us to set ourselves as the owner.
However, to successfully call `receive()`, we first need to make a non-zero contribution by calling `contribute()` and sending a non-zero amount (e.g., 1 wei) with that function call.
We can achieve this in the Ethernaut console as follows:

```javascript
contract.contribute({value: 1})
```

Now that our address has made a contribution to the contract, we can call `receive()` by sending an arbitrary, non-zero ether amount (e.g., 1 wei) to the contract.
The easiest way to do this is to simply use MetaMask.
After that transfer, we are the new owner of the contract, which allows us to call `withdraw()` to reduce the contract's balance to zero.
