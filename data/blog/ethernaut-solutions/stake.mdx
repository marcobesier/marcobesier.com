# Ethernaut - Stake - Solution

## Contract

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
contract Stake {

    uint256 public totalStaked;
    mapping(address => uint256) public UserStake;
    mapping(address => bool) public Stakers;
    address public WETH;

    constructor(address _weth) payable{
        totalStaked += msg.value;
        WETH = _weth;
    }

    function StakeETH() public payable {
        require(msg.value > 0.001 ether, "Don't be cheap");
        totalStaked += msg.value;
        UserStake[msg.sender] += msg.value;
        Stakers[msg.sender] = true;
    }
    function StakeWETH(uint256 amount) public returns (bool){
        require(amount >  0.001 ether, "Don't be cheap");
        (,bytes memory allowance) = WETH.call(abi.encodeWithSelector(0xdd62ed3e, msg.sender,address(this)));
        require(bytesToUint(allowance) >= amount,"How am I moving the funds honey?");
        totalStaked += amount;
        UserStake[msg.sender] += amount;
        (bool transfered, ) = WETH.call(abi.encodeWithSelector(0x23b872dd, msg.sender,address(this),amount));
        Stakers[msg.sender] = true;
        return transfered;
    }

    function Unstake(uint256 amount) public returns (bool){
        require(UserStake[msg.sender] >= amount,"Don't be greedy");
        UserStake[msg.sender] -= amount;
        totalStaked -= amount;
        (bool success, ) = payable(msg.sender).call{value : amount}("");
        return success;
    }
    function bytesToUint(bytes memory data) internal pure returns (uint256) {
        require(data.length >= 32, "Data length must be at least 32 bytes");
        uint256 result;
        assembly {
            result := mload(add(data, 0x20))
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```

## Solution

The goal of this level is to manipulate the level instance's contract state such that:

1. The `Stake` contract's ETH balance is greater than 0.
2. `totalStaked` is greater than the `Stake` contract's ETH balance.
3. Our player EOA is registered as a staker.
4. Our player EOA's staked balance is 0.

To fulfill requirements 3. and 4., we first call `StakeETH()` and subsequently `Unstake()`, specifying the first call's value as the second call's `amount`.

To fulfill requirement 1., we can use an account different from our player EOA (let's call that account "minion") and call `StakeETH()` from our minion's account.
Notice that this leaves requirements 3. and 4. intact.

Lastly, to fulfill requirement 2., we first notice that `0xdd62ed3e` is the function selector for `WETH`'s `allowance()` while `0x23b872dd` is the selector for `transferFrom()`.
Furthermore, we see that the return value of the low-level call

```solidity
(bool transfered, ) = WETH.call(abi.encodeWithSelector(0x23b872dd, msg.sender,address(this),amount));
```

is not properly validated.
In other words, `StakeWETH()` does not revert if the external function call reverts.
Instead, it simply continues execution.

Therefore, we can fulfill requirement 2. by having our minion call

1. `approve()` on the `WETH` contract, specifying a non-zero `_value` and the level instance as the `_spender` (to determine `WETH`'s address, use `await contract.WETH()` in the Ethernaut console). 
2.  `StakeWETH()` specifying the allowance given in step 1. as the `amount`.
