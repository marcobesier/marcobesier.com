# Ethernaut - Dex Two - Solution

## Contract

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "openzeppelin-contracts-08/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol";
import "openzeppelin-contracts-08/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";
import "openzeppelin-contracts-08/access/Ownable.sol";

contract DexTwo is Ownable {
    address public token1;
    address public token2;

    constructor() {}

    function setTokens(address _token1, address _token2) public onlyOwner {
        token1 = _token1;
        token2 = _token2;
    }

    function add_liquidity(address token_address, uint256 amount) public onlyOwner {
        IERC20(token_address).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
    }

    function swap(address from, address to, uint256 amount) public {
        require(IERC20(from).balanceOf(msg.sender) >= amount, "Not enough to swap");
        uint256 swapAmount = getSwapAmount(from, to, amount);
        IERC20(from).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
        IERC20(to).approve(address(this), swapAmount);
        IERC20(to).transferFrom(address(this), msg.sender, swapAmount);
    }

    function getSwapAmount(address from, address to, uint256 amount) public view returns (uint256) {
        return ((amount * IERC20(to).balanceOf(address(this))) / IERC20(from).balanceOf(address(this)));
    }

    function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) public {
        SwappableTokenTwo(token1).approve(msg.sender, spender, amount);
        SwappableTokenTwo(token2).approve(msg.sender, spender, amount);
    }

    function balanceOf(address token, address account) public view returns (uint256) {
        return IERC20(token).balanceOf(account);
    }
}

contract SwappableTokenTwo is ERC20 {
    address private _dex;

    constructor(address dexInstance, string memory name, string memory symbol, uint256 initialSupply)
        ERC20(name, symbol)
    {
        _mint(msg.sender, initialSupply);
        _dex = dexInstance;
    }

    function approve(address owner, address spender, uint256 amount) public {
        require(owner != _dex, "InvalidApprover");
        super._approve(owner, spender, amount);
    }
}
```

## Solution

The goal of this challenge is to steal all `token1` and `token2` funds from the dex.

The contract is exactly the same as in Dex One with the only exception that the `swap()` function is missing the following check:

```solidity
require((from == token1 && to == token2) || (from == token2 && to == token1), "Invalid tokens");
```

In other words, anyone can list their own tokens!

Consequently, we can simply deploy a new ERC20 token through Remix and swap this new token for `token1` and `token2` to drain the corresponding funds from the dex.

To start the attack, we deploy the following ERC20 contract:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

contract Dex2Attacker is ERC20 {
    constructor() ERC20("Dex2 Attacker", "D2A") {
        _mint(msg.sender, 1 * 10 ** decimals());
    }
}
```

Next, our goal is to swap a specific amount of our `D2A` token for `token1` and `token2`, respectively, such that `swapAmount` equals 100.
So, to drain `token1` from the dex, we can use the following sequence:

1. Transfer 100 `D2A` to the dex (so that there is no division by 0 in `getSwapAmount()`).
2. Approve the dex for 100 `D2A`.
3. Swap 100 `D2A` for 100 `token1`.

After this sequence, the dex has a `D2A` balance of 200. 
So, to drain `token2` from the dex as well, we first need to compute the suitable amount of `D2A` that we need to swap in order to get 100 `token2` back.
More specifically, we need to solve the equation

```solidity
100 == amount * 100 / 200
```

for `amount`, which tells us that we need to specify `amount=200` to get a `swapAmount` of 100.
In other words, we need to swap 200 `D2A` to get 100 `token2` back. 
Our remaining steps are, therefore, the following:

1. Approve the dex for 200 `D2A`.
2. Swap 200 `D2A` for 100 `token2`.

This leaves the dex with a balance of 400 of our worthless `D2A` tokens and a balance of 0 for both `token1` and `token2`.
