# Ethernaut - Delegation - Solution

## Contract

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Delegate {
    address public owner;

    constructor(address _owner) {
        owner = _owner;
    }

    function pwn() public {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }
}

contract Delegation {
    address public owner;
    Delegate delegate;

    constructor(address _delegateAddress) {
        delegate = Delegate(_delegateAddress);
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    fallback() external {
        (bool result,) = address(delegate).delegatecall(msg.data);
        if (result) {
            this;
        }
    }
}
```

## Exploit

Our goal in this level is to become the owner of the `Delegate` contract.
To achieve this, we can send a transaction to the `Delegation` contract, specifying the `pwn()` function's selector in the calldata.
This will trigger `Delegation`'s `fallback()` function since `pwn()`'s function selector does not correspond to any function in `Delegation`.
The `fallback()` function will in turn make a `delegatecall` to the `Delegate` contract's `pwn()` function since our calldata matches `pwn()`'s selector.
Since we "delegatecalled" `pwn()`, `msg.sender` is still our externally owned account's address, making us the new owner of the `Delegate` contract.

To sum up, one needs to perform two steps to solve this level:

1. Compute `pwn()`'s function selector. It reads `0xdd365b8b`. (Recall that the function selector is the first four bytes of the keccak256 hash of the function signature. There are several [tools](https://www.evm-function-selector.click/) available to compute it in no time.)
2. Send the transaction explained above using the Ethernaut console via:
```javascript
contract.sendTransaction({data: "0xdd365b8b"})
```
