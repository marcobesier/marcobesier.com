# Ethernaut - Naught Coin - Solution

## Contract

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

contract NaughtCoin is ERC20 {

  // string public constant name = 'NaughtCoin';
  // string public constant symbol = '0x0';
  // uint public constant decimals = 18;
  uint public timeLock = block.timestamp + 10 * 365 days;
  uint256 public INITIAL_SUPPLY;
  address public player;

  constructor(address _player)
  ERC20('NaughtCoin', '0x0') {
    player = _player;
    INITIAL_SUPPLY = 1000000 * (10**uint256(decimals()));
    // _totalSupply = INITIAL_SUPPLY;
    // _balances[player] = INITIAL_SUPPLY;
    _mint(player, INITIAL_SUPPLY);
    emit Transfer(address(0), player, INITIAL_SUPPLY);
  }

  function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) override public lockTokens returns(bool) {
    super.transfer(_to, _value);
  }

  // Prevent the initial owner from transferring tokens until the timelock has passed
  modifier lockTokens() {
    if (msg.sender == player) {
      require(block.timestamp > timeLock);
      _;
    } else {
     _;
    }
  }
}
```

## Exploit

This challenge is conveniently solved via Remix. The goal is to transfer all tokens from the `player`'s account to another address. At first sight, this looks like an impossible thing to do because the `lockTokens` modifier prevents the `player` from executing `transfer` during the first 10 years after contract deployment.

However, notice that the ERC-20 interface exposes _two_ functions that facilitate token transfers: `transfer` and `transferFrom`.

In the above contract, `transfer` is overridden and protected by `lockTokens`. `transferFrom`, however, is _not_ overridden and, in particular, _not_ protected by the `lockTokens` modifier!

Therefore, we can solve this challenge using the following steps:

1. Deploy the contract, setting `_player` to an address we control.
2. Use `player`'s account to approve a second account we control for the entire `INITIAL_SUPPLY`.
3. Call `transferFrom` from our second account, specifying `player` as the `_from` parameter and `INITIAL_SUPPLY` for the `_value` parameter. Since the only goal of the challenge is to remove all tokens from the `player`'s account, we can specify an arbitrary address for the `_to` parameter (except the `player`'s address).
