# Ethernaut - Gatekeeper Two - Solution

## Contract

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract GatekeeperTwo {
    address public entrant;

    modifier gateOne() {
        require(msg.sender != tx.origin);
        _;
    }

    modifier gateTwo() {
        uint256 x;
        assembly {
            x := extcodesize(caller())
        }
        require(x == 0);
        _;
    }

    modifier gateThree(bytes8 _gateKey) {
        require(uint64(bytes8(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender)))) ^ uint64(_gateKey) == type(uint64).max);
        _;
    }

    function enter(bytes8 _gateKey) public gateOne gateTwo gateThree(_gateKey) returns (bool) {
        entrant = tx.origin;
        return true;
    }
}
```

## Solution

The goal of this level is to register yourself as an `entrant`.

To pass `gateOne()`, we need to call `enter()` from a contract rather than from our EOA.
At first sight, this looks like a direct contradiction to the second gate since `gateTwo()` requires `extcodesize(caller())` to equal zero.
However, section 7.1 of the [Ethereum Yellow Paper](https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf) tells us that _"while the initialisation code is executing, the newly created address exists but with no intrinsic body code."_
In other words, if we call `enter()` in the constructor of a contract, `gateTwo()` will determine that the `extcodesize()` of that contract is zero.

To understand how we can pass `gateThree()`, let's take a closer look at the corresponding `require` statement.
Our goal is to pass a `bytes8 _gateKey` such that the left-hand side (LHS) becomes `type(uint64).max`, i.e., the largest 64-bit unsigned integer.
Here is what this number looks like in different integer representations:

    - Decimal positional system: 18446744073709551615
    - Binary positional system: 1111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111
    - Hexadecimal positional system: 0xffffffffffffffff

_Note: If you're not familiar with integer representations, section 3.2.5 of [The MoonMath Manual](https://github.com/LeastAuthority/moonmath-manual?tab=readme-ov-file) is a great introduction to the topic._

Taking a closer look at the LHS, the first important thing to notice is that `msg.sender` will be the address of the calling contract.
Without loss of generality, let's assume this address is 0x5B38Da6a701c568545dCfcB03FcB875f56beddC4 so that we can compute a concrete example of the first operand on the LHS via [Chisel](https://book.getfoundry.sh/chisel/):

```
➜ uint64(bytes8(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(myAddress))))
Type: uint64
├ Hex: 0x5931b4ed56ace4c4
├ Hex (full word): 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000005931b4ed56ace4c4
└ Decimal: 6427117074688828612
```

The binary representation of this number is 0101100100110001101101001110110101010110101011001110010011000100.
In order for the `^` (XOR) operation to yield the largest 64-bit unsigned integer, 111...111, the second operand needs to be the [bitwise NOT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#NOT) of the first operand.
In Solidity, the bitwise NOT can be applied via `~`.

As a conclusion, we can solve the level by deploying the following contract, specifying our level-instance address as the `victim`:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

interface IGatekeeperTwo {
    function enter(bytes8 gateKey) external returns (bool);
}

contract GatekeeperTwoAttacker {
    IGatekeeperTwo public immutable VICTIM;

    constructor(address victim) {
        VICTIM = IGatekeeperTwo(victim);
        VICTIM.enter(~bytes8(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(address(this)))));
    }
}
```
