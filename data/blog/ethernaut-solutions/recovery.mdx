# Ethernaut - Recovery - Solution

## Contract

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Recovery {
    //generate tokens
    function generateToken(string memory _name, uint256 _initialSupply) public {
        new SimpleToken(_name, msg.sender, _initialSupply);
    }
}

contract SimpleToken {
    string public name;
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;

    // constructor
    constructor(string memory _name, address _creator, uint256 _initialSupply) {
        name = _name;
        balances[_creator] = _initialSupply;
    }

    // collect ether in return for tokens
    receive() external payable {
        balances[msg.sender] = msg.value * 10;
    }

    // allow transfers of tokens
    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _amount) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount);
        balances[msg.sender] = balances[msg.sender] - _amount;
        balances[_to] = _amount;
    }

    // clean up after ourselves
    function destroy(address payable _to) public {
        selfdestruct(_to);
    }
}
```

## Exploit

The goal of this challenge is determine the address of the `SimpleToken` contract and recover the 0.001 ETH that the contract creator sent to it. 

As a first step, we search for the level instance address, i.e., the address of the `Recovery` contract, on [sepolia.etherscan.io](https://sepolia.etherscan.io).
Looking at the _Internal Transactions_ tab, we see two _Contract Creation_ transactions.
One of them has the level instance address as its _From_ address, telling us that it corresponds to the creation of the `SimpleToken` contract in the constructor of the `Recovery` contract.
If we click on its _Contract Creation_ link under _To_, Etherscan will take us to the detail view of the `SimpleToken` contract.
In particular, it will reveal the `SimpleToken`'s contract address.
Knowing this address, we can now call the `destroy()` function, specifying an arbitrary address, e.g., our `player`, as the `_to` parameter.
 
```bash
cast send <your level instance> "destroy(address)" <your player address> --private-key <your private key> --rpc-url $SEP_RPC_URL
```
